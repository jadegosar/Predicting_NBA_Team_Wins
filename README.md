# Predicting NBA Team Wins in 2021-22 season

## Introduction
The motivation for this project stemmed from a NBA offseason that featured a massive wave of player movement through free-agent signings and trades which dramatically shifted team odds of winning a championship. Due to the drastically different NBA landscape for the 21-22 season, we wanted to explore the impact that individual trades and signings would have on a team's projected success for the season before any games were played.
